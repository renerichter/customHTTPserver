# Challenge 03 -- Basic CRUD Application without Frameworks

## The Challenge

- Build a **basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system** to manage travel bookings using **PostgreSQL**. You’ll interact directly with PostgreSQL by writing raw SQL queries without using any ORM frameworks.
- Use Python’s built-in `psycopg2` library to:
    - Establish connections to the PostgreSQL database.
    - Execute **raw SQL queries** for managing bookings.
    - Ensure transactional consistency using manual `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` SQL commands.
- Demonstrate manual handling of database connections, query execution, and safe use of transactions, especially focusing on:
    - Preventing SQL injection.
    - Managing **concurrent transactions** and dealing with potential issues like deadlocks.
