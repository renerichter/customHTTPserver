# Challenge 08 -- Custom Asynchronous Task Queue

## The Challenge

- Implement a **custom task queue** using Pythonâ€™s built-in `queue` module to process bookings asynchronously. Simulate background tasks like sending booking confirmation emails after bookings are completed. The task queue should handle failures and retry logic.
- This tests your understanding of concurrent programming, task scheduling, and message-driven architectures without relying on pre-built solutions like `Celery`.
