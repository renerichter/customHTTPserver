# Challenge 10 -- Manual Authentication and Authorization System

## The Challenge

- Design and implement a **basic authentication system** from scratch (e.g., using session tokens or a simplified JWT-like system). Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (e.g., admin, customer) in the booking system.
- Youâ€™ll need to manually handle token generation, validation, and role-based authorization, avoiding external libraries like OAuth or any security frameworks.
