# Challenge 06 -- Manual Data Caching

## The Challenge

- Implement a custom **in-memory caching system** for the booking data. This cache should store frequently accessed data (e.g., top destinations), with a manual **cache invalidation policy** when new bookings are made.
- Focuses on performance optimizations and requires careful thought about memory management, cache eviction strategies, and data consistency.
