# Challenge 09 -- Custom Load Balancer Implementation

## The Challenge

- Build a **custom load balancer** from scratch that distributes incoming HTTP requests to multiple instances of your custom HTTP server (built in Task 5). Implement health checks to route traffic away from failing servers.
- This tests your ability to implement load balancing algorithms and system reliability measures without the help of established tools like HAProxy or NGINX
